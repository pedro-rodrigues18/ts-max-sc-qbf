## How to Use

The project uses a `Makefile` to manage compilation and execution in a Linux environment.

**1. Compile the code**

To compile the project and generate the executable, run:

```bash
make
```

**2. Run the program**

After compilation, to run the program, use:

```bash
make run
```

**3. Clean compiled files**

To remove the files generated by the compilation (object files and the executable), run:

```bash
make clean
```
